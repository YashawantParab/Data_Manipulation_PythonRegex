Assignment No: 3 
***Neural Network***

To adjust the appropriate amount of weights and biases, 
we need to derivative the loss function with respect to the weights and biases.

Line number 30 and 31 has some changes regaring to the iteration.

        self.weights1 += d_weights1
        self.weights2 += d_weights2

We need to modify code with "+" to get the output with respect to weights and biases.

To get the slope of the loss function we add values in previous steps.
